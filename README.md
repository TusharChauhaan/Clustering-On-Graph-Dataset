# Clustering-On-Graph-Dataset
Implemented clustering algorithm on MovieActor dataset to group similar actors and movies. Computed performance based on the custom performance metric. Converted every vertices in 128 dimensional vector with the help of word2vec and graph algorithms. Reduced the dimensionality of the vector into 2 dimensions using T-distributed Stochastic Neighbourhood Embedding (tSNE) and plotted it using matplotlib.
